Miscellaneous bits of documentation that don't really fit anywhere else

@namespace Install
You have four methods of installing Leaflet.Draw, copy the leaflet.draw.js, css, and images from dist and embed directly
into your application.

### npm
To install the plugin run `npm install leaflet-draw` via command line in your project.
You must also require this in your project like so: `var leafletDraw = require('leaflet-draw');`

### bower
To install the plugin run `bower install leaflet-draw`.

### Builder
There is a custom builder at [../build/build.html](../build/build.html) to help make a custom package of Leaflet.Draw
with the command line.

@namespace Options

You can configure the plugin by using the different options listed here. If you identify a typo or have a suggestion
for this section of the documentation, please edit docs-misc.leafdoc in the build directory.

@namespace Control.Draw

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| position | String | `'topleft'` | The initial position of the control (one of the map corners). See [control positions](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-positions). |
| draw | [DrawOptions](#drawoptions) | `{}` | The options used to configure the draw toolbar. |
| edit | [EditPolyOptions](#editpolyoptions) | `false` | The options used to configure the edit toolbar. |


@namespace DrawOptions

| Option    | Type  | Default   | Description   |
| --------- | ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| polyline     | [PolylineOptions](#polylineoptions)         | `{ }` | Polyline draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.      |
| polygon      | [PolygonOptions](#polygonoptions)           | `{ }` | Polygon draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.       |
| rectangle    | [RectangleOptions](#rectangleoptions)       | `{ }` | Rectangle draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.     |
| circle       | [CircleOptions](#circleoptions)             | `{ }` | Circle draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.        |
| marker       | [MarkerOptions](#markeroptions)             | `{ }` | Marker draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.        |
| circlemarker | [CircleMarkerOptions](#circlemarkeroptions) | `{ }` | Circle marker draw handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler. |

@namespace PolylineOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| allowIntersection | Bool | `true` | Determines if line segments can cross.
| drawError | Object | [See code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/src/draw/handler/Draw.Polyline.js#L10) | Configuration options for the error that displays if an intersection is detected.
| guidelineDistance | Number | `20` | Distance in pixels between each guide dash.
| shapeOptions | [Leaflet Polyline options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#polyline-options) | [See code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/src/draw/handler/Draw.Polyline.js#L20) | The options used when drawing the polyline/polygon on the map.
| showLength | Bool | `true` | Show the length of the drawn line. **The area is only approximate and become less accurate the larger the polygon is.**
| metric | Bool | `true` | Use the metric measurement system.
| feet | Bool | `true` | Use feet instead of yards and miles, when not using the metric measurement system.
| nautic | Bool | `false` | Use nautic miles instead of yards and miles, when not using the metric measurement system nor feet.
| zIndexOffset | Number | `2000` | This should be a high number to ensure that you can draw over all other layers on the map.
| repeatMode | Bool | `false` | Determines if the draw tool remains enabled after drawing a shape.


@namespace PolygonOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| showArea | Bool | `false` | Show the area of the drawn polygon in m², ha or km². **The area is only approximate and become less accurate the larger the polygon is.**
| showLength | Bool | `false` | Show the length of the drawn line. **The area is only approximate and become less accurate the larger the polygon is.**
| metric | Object | `true` | Use the metric measurement system. Can be a boolean value, but can also be an array to specify which units to use. Possible units are `km` (kilometers), `ha` (hectares), `m` (metres). So a value of `['km', 'm']` means that the length will be shown in metres and, when more than a 1000 metres, in kilometers, and the area will be shown in m² or km² and acres will not be used.
| feet | Bool | `true` | Use feet instead of yards and miles, when not using the metric measurement system.
| nautic | Bool | `false` | Use nautic miles instead of yards and miles, when not using the metric measurement system nor feet.
| precision | Object | `{km: 2, ha: 2, m: 0, mi: 2, ac: 2, yd: 0, ft: 0, nm: 2}` | Defines the precision to use for numbers of each type of unit. Possible units are `km` (kilometers), `ha` (hectares), `m` (metres), `mi` (miles), `ac` (acres), `ya` (yards), `ft` (feet), `nm` (nautical miles). For example `{km: 1}` changes the default precision for km and km² to one which gives values like `1.5 km` and `15.0 km²` in stead of `1.53 km` and `15.01 km²`.


@namespace RectangleOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| shapeOptions | [Leaflet Path options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#path-options) | [See code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/src/draw/handler/Draw.Rectangle.js#L7) | The options used when drawing the rectangle on the map.
| repeatMode | Bool | `false` | Determines if the draw tool remains enabled after drawing a shape.

@namespace CircleOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| shapeOptions | [Leaflet Path options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#path-options) | [See code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/src/draw/handler/Draw.Circle.js#L7) | The options used when drawing the circle on the map.
| repeatMode | Bool | `false` | Determines if the draw tool remains enabled after drawing a shape.
| showRadius | Bool | `true` | Show the area of the drawn circle in m², ha or km². **The area is only approximate and become less accurate the larger the circle is.**


@namespace MarkerOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| icon | [Leaflet Icon](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#icon) | `L.Icon.Default()` | The icon displayed when drawing a marker.
| zIndexOffset | Number | `2000` | This should be a high number to ensure that you can draw over all other layers on the map.
| repeatMode | Bool | `false` | Determines if the draw tool remains enabled after drawing a shape.


@namespace EditPolyOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| featureGroup | [Leaflet FeatureGroup](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#featuregroup) | `null` | This is the FeatureGroup that stores all editable shapes. **THIS IS REQUIRED FOR THE EDIT TOOLBAR TO WORK**
| edit | [EditHandlerOptions](#edithandleroptions) | `{ }` | Edit handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.
| remove | [DeleteHandlerOptions](#deletehandleroptions) | `{ }` | Delete handler options. Set to `false` to disable handler.
| poly | [EditPolyOptions](#editpoly) |  `{ }` | Set polygon editing options
| allowIntersection | Bool | `true` |  Determines if line segments can cross.

@namespace EditHandlerOptions

| Option | Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| selectedPathOptions | [Leaflet Path options](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#path-options) | [See code](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/src/edit/handler/EditToolbar.Edit.js#L9) | The path options for how the layers will look while in edit mode. If this is set to null the editable path options will not be set.

**Note:** To maintain the original layer color of the layer use `maintainColor: true` within `selectedPathOptions`.

E.g. The edit options below will maintain the layer color and set the edit opacity to 0.3.

````js
{
	selectedPathOptions: {
		maintainColor: true,
		opacity: 0.3
	}
}
````

@namespace version

A constant that represents the Leaflet.Draw version in use.

```js
    L.drawVersion; // contains "0.4.2" (or whatever version is currently in use)
```
