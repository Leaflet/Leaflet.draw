# Important
You will need to download the latest Leaflet from master in the [Github repo](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) before Leaflet.draw 0.2.0 will work.

#Leaflet.draw
Adds support for drawing and editing vectors and markers on [Leaflet maps](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet). Check out the [demo](http://leaflet.github.com/Leaflet.draw/)

#### Upgrading from Leaflet.draw 0.1

Leaflet.draw 0.2.0 changes a LOT of things from 0.1. Please see [BREAKING CHANGES](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/blob/master/BREAKINGCHANGES.md) for how to upgrade.

## Using the plugin

The default state for the control is the draw toolbar just below the zoom control. This will allow map users to draw vectors and markers. **Please note the edit toolbar is not enabled by default.**

Too add the draw toolbar set the option `drawControl: true` in the map options.

````js
// create a map in the "map" div, set the view to a given place and zoom
var map = L.map('map', {drawControl: true}).setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

// add an OpenStreetMap tile layer
L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);
````

### Adding the edit toolbar

To use the edit toolbar you must initialise the Leaflet.draw control and manually add it to the map.

````js
// create a map in the "map" div, set the view to a given place and zoom
var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

// add an OpenStreetMap tile layer
L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

// Initialize the FeatureGroup to store editable layers
var drawnItems = new L.FeatureGroup();
map.addLayer(drawnItems);

// Initialize the draw control and pass it the FeatureGroup of editable layers
var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
	edit: {
		featureGroup: drawnItems
	}
});
map.addControl(drawControl);
````

The key here is the `featureGroup` option. This tells the plugin which `FeatureGroup` that contains the layers that should be editable.

### Events

Once you have successfully added the Leaflet.draw plugin your map you will want to respond to the different actions users can do. The following events will be triggered on the map:

#### draw:created

| layerType | String | The type of layer this is. One of: `polyline`, `polygon`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `marker`


Triggered when a new vector or marker has been created.

````js
map.on('draw:created', function (e) {
	var type = e.layerType,
		layer = e.layer;

	if (type === 'marker') {

````js
map.on('draw:edited', function (e) {
	var layers = e.layers;
	layers.eachLayer(function (layer) {
		//do whatever you want, most likely save back to db
	});
});

## Common tasks

The following examples outline some common tasks.

### Example Leaflet.draw config

The following example will show you how to:

1. Change the position of the control's toolbar.
2. Customize the styles of a vector layer.
3. Use a custom marker.
4. Disable the delete functionality.

````js
var cloudmadeUrl = 'http://{s}.tile.cloudmade.com/BC9A493B41014CAABB98F0471D759707/997/256/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
	cloudmade = new L.TileLayer(cloudmadeUrl, {maxZoom: 18}),
	map = new L.Map('map', {layers: [cloudmade], center: new L.LatLng(-37.7772, 175.2756), zoom: 15 });

var editableLayers = new L.FeatureGroup();
map.addLayer(editableLayers);

var MyCustomMarker = L.Icon.extend({
	options: {
		shadowUrl: null,
		iconAnchor: new L.Point(12, 12),
		iconSize: new L.Point(24, 24),
		iconUrl: 'link/to/image.png'
	}
});

var options = {
	position: 'topright',
	draw: {
		polyline: {
			title: 'Draw a kick ass polyline!'
			shapeOptions: {
				color: '#f357a1',
				weight: 10
			}
		},
		polygon: {
			allowIntersection: false, // Restricts shapes to simple polygons
			drawError: {
				color: '#e1e100, // Color the shape will turn when intersects
				message: '<strong>Oh snap!<strong> you can\'t draw that!' // Message that will show when intersect
			},
			shapeOptions: {
				color: '#bada55'
			}
		},
		circle: false, // Turns off this drawing tool
		rectangle: {
			shapeOptions: {
				clickable: false
			}
		},
		marker: {
			icon: new MyCustomMarker()
		}
	},
	edit: {
		featureGroup: editableLayers, //REQUIRED!!
		remove: false
	}
};

var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw(options);
map.addControl(drawControl);

map.on('draw:created', function (e) {
	var type = e.layerType,
		layer = e.layer;

	if (type === 'marker') {
		layer.bindPopup('A popup!');
	}

	drawnItems.addLayer(layer);
});
````

### Disabling a toolbar

If you do not want a particular toolbar in your app you can turn it off by setting the toolbar to false.

````js
var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
	draw: false,
	edit: {
		featureGroup: editableLayers
	}
});
````

### Disabling a toolbar item

If you want to turn off a particular toolbar item, set it to false. The following disables drawing polygons and markers. It also turns off the ability to edit layers.

````js
var drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
	draw: {
		polygon: false,
		marker: false
	},
	edit: {
		featureGroup: editableLayers,
		edit: false
	}
});
````

### Changing a drawing handlers options

You can change a draw handlers options after initialization by using the `setDrawingOptions` method on the Leaflet.draw control.

E.g. to change the colour of the rectangle:

````js
drawControl.setDrawingOptions(
    rectangle: {
        color: '#0000FF'
    }
);
````

## Thanks

Thanks so much to [@brunob](https://github.com/brunob), [@tnightingale](https://github.com/tnightingale), and [@shramov](https://github.com/shramov). I got a lot of ideas from their Leaflet plugins.

All the [contributors](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/graphs/contributors) and issue reporters of this plugin rock. Thanks for tidying up my mess and keeping the plugin on track.

The icons used for some of the toolbar buttons are either from http://glyphicons.com/ or inspired by them. <3 Glyphicons!

Finally, [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner) is the man! Thanks for dedicating so much of your time to create the gosh darn best JavaScript mapping library around.
